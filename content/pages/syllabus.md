Homework assignments must be submitted at the beginning of class on the due date. All writing assignments must be handed in by the end of the exam period to receive credit in this course.

Daily Grade
-----------

You are asked to perform the assigned Core Conversations (CC) and Drills as well as to utilize new structure patterns of each lesson in ACT class. The instructor will check your performance in terms of your pronunciation, accuracy, fluency, and naturalness according to the following scale:

*   10 = excellent performance
*   9 = clearly well prepared; strong performance with minor errors
*   8 = clearly prepared; fair performance
*   7 = evidently prepared but weak in major areas
*   6 = present, but evidently unprepared
*   0 = absent

Keep in mind that your performance on reading will be evaluated and recorded as part of your daily grade.

Exams and Quizzes
-----------------

There are two interview tests and five Lesson Quizzes. A number of Vocabulary Quizzes and Kanji Quizzes are given throughout the semester. Please note: no make-up quizzes or exams are given in this course.

Writing Assignments
-------------------

Assignments are due at the beginning of the class. Submitting the assignments late will result in a deduction of 0.5 each day.

Attendance Policy
-----------------

It is essential that you attend the class regularly. If you miss more than **five** classes you will be advised to withdraw from the course. Students are expected to come to class on time. Coming to class late not only results in missed quizzes and poorer performance, but also distracts other students. In case you have to miss classes due to academic related matter, inform the instructor in advance.
